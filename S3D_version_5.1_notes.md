### Embedded Thumbnail Preview Images

Simplify3D can now embed a thumbnail image of your print directly into exported build files. These images can then be displayed on the printer LCD itself providing useful verification during build setup and printer operation. Simplify3D supports thumbnails with many different formats, resolutions, and settings, enabling compatibility with dozens of popular machines and applications.
